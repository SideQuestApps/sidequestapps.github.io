        </h3>

        <p>
        At SideQuest Apps, protecting your privacy is a top priority. 
        We are committed to handling any personal data collected with care and transparency. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.
        </p>

        <h3>
        What Information We Collect:
        </h3>

        <p>
        We may collect non-personal information, such as device type, operating system, crash logs, performance diagnostics, and anonymous usage statistics. This data helps us improve app stability, optimize features, and enhance overall user experience. No personal or sensitive data (like names, email addresses, or contact details) is collected unless directly provided for support or feedback.
        </p>

        <h3>
        How We Use Your Data:
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        The information collected is solely used to analyze app performance, troubleshoot issues, and refine user experience. Our goal is to make our apps smarter, faster, and more reliable for everyone.
        </p>

        <h3>
        Data Sharing & Sales:
        </h3>

        <p>
        We do not sell your information to anyone. Data collected is never shared with third parties except as required for technical support or necessary app functionality (e.g., analytics services)—and only under strict confidentiality agreements.
        </p>

        <h3>
        Your Choices & Rights:
        </h3>

        <p>
        You may opt out of diagnostics or analytics where settings permit. If you provide personal information for support, you have full rights to request deletion of your data at any time.
        </p>

        <h3>
        Policy Updates:
        </h3>

        <p>
        We may update this privacy policy periodically. Updates will be posted within the app and on our website, with version date revisions.
        </p>
